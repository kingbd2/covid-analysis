# Axios Actions

> Bundle endpoints as callable, reusable units

## Intro

Axios Actions comprises a small set of classes which allows you to collate and call URLs as actions:

```js
const collection = new <ApiClass>(axios, actions)
```
```js
collection
  .<action>(<data>)
  .then(<handler>)
```

This collection-based approach allows you to set up APIs without scattering URLs and handler code throughout your application; you set up your endpoints once, then import and use these robust, functional units where needed.

The end result is a significant reduction in application complexity (especially where replacing the Flux pattern) but without sacrificing separation of concerns.


## Main classes

### ApiGroup

The `ApiGroup` class is the base building block for actions.

You set it up with an axios instance and a configuration block:

```js
export const widgets = new ApiGroup(axios, {
  view: 'api/products/widgets?category=:category',
  load: 'api/products/widgets/:id',
  save: 'POST api/products/widgets/:id',
})
```

Note that:

- HTTP methods can be specified directly in the URL format
- placeholder variables are automatically filled-in using passed data
- placeholders can be used anywhere in the string
- You can use `:value` or `{value}` style placeholders

To use the endpoint, import it, then either `call()` the action by name, or execute it directly:

```js
import { widgets } from '../api'

// call by name
widgets.call('load', 1).then(onLoad)

// execute directly
widgets.load(1).then(onLoad)
```

Note that `ApiGroup` will **not** override existing properties or methods with new ones.


### ApiEndpoint

The `ApiEndpoint` class extends `ApiGroup` to automatically set up REST verbs, paths and CRUD actions:

```js
const posts = new ApiEndpoint(axios, 'posts/:id')
```

This makes it even easier to call REST endpoints as methods [are declared](https://github.com/davestewart/axios-actions/blob/master/src/classes/ApiEndpoint.ts#L63-L109) on the class:

```js
posts.index()       // GET
posts.create(data)  // POST
posts.read(1)       // GET
posts.update(data)  // PATCH
posts.delete(1)     // DELETE
```

If your endpoints are not strictly REST, pass in a configuration object instead:

```js
const posts = new ApiEndpoint(axios, {
  index:  'posts/index',       // GET
  create: 'posts/create',      // POST
  read:   'posts/view/:id',    // GET
  update: 'posts/update/:id',  // POST
  delete: 'posts/delete/:id'   // POST
})
```

For object configuration, the class is configured to use `GET` for `index` / `read` and `POST` for everything else. If you want to override these defaults, indicate the correct HTTP method within the URL string:



```js
{ update: 'PATCH posts/update/:id' }
```


### ApiResource

The `ApiResource` class extends `ApiEndpoint` and is supplied primarily to demonstrate the package's core features working together in a single class.

In addition to

- `ApiCore` features such as `loading` state and `error` messages
- `ApiGroup` features such as actions and `when()` handlers
- `ApiEndpoint` actions `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete` and `index`

it:

- provides an additional `search` action
- saves `items` and `item` data on the instance itself
- uses the `resource` plugin to optionally convert to and from a supplied Model
- uses the `when` handler to optionally reload `index` on successful `create`, `update` and `delete` operations

The class is designed to encapsulate all API-related functionality in a single place, making it as simple as possible to call endpoints and update your UI without leaking logic or data into composing components.

The following is a Vue example:

```js
data () {
  return {
    api: new ApiResource(axios, 'comments/:id', Comment, true)
  }
}
```
```vue
<button @click="api.index()">Load</button>
<section :class="{ loading: api.loading }">
  <comment v-if="api.items" v-for="model in api.items" v-bind="model" />
  <error v-if="api.error" />
</section>
```

Note that there are **no component-level variables** such as `loading`, `error`, `data` or handlers for any action or subsequent assignment, for example:

```js
// x 6 actions
create (data) {
  this.api
    .create(data)
    .then(res => this.data = res.data)
    .catch(error => this.error = error.message)
}
``` 

Check the demo online to see it in action:

- https://axios-actions.netlify.com/#/api/resource

Its implementation should cover a broad range of use cases, but where it doesn't (for example adding additional pagination methods) it's a simple case of extending the class or even duplicating the [original source](https://github.com/davestewart/axios-actions/blob/master/src/classes/ApiResource.ts) and creating your own `ApiResource` class.

## ApiCore

All classes extend from the `ApiCore` class which contains base functionality for:

- HTTP methods `get()`, `post()` and `request()`
- event handling via `done()` and `fail()`
- loading state via `loading`
- error state via `error`
- plugins via `use()`


```js
import { ApiCore } from 'axios-endpoints'

// create new Api instance
this.api = new ApiCore(axios)
  // return data not repsonse
  .use('data')
  
  // add global handlers
  .done(data => this.comments = data)
  .fail(error => this.error = this.api.error.message)

// call an endpoint directly
this.api.get('api/comments')
```

In your application's view, you can sync with instance properties (for any of the classes) to show progress and updates: 

```html
<error v-if="api.error">{{ api.error }}</error>
<loading v-else-if="api.loading" />
<div v-else>
  <comment v-for="commment in comments" :model="comment" />
</div>
```

Note that each Api class instance monitors its own loading progress, and will report loaded only when **all** requests have loaded. This way you can have separate, lightweight Api instances for individual components or sections of your site.

See the class itself for all methods:

- [src/classes/ApiCore.ts](https://github.com/davestewart/axios-actions/blob/master/src/classes/ApiCore.ts)


## Basic functionality

### Axios configuration

The package acts as a layer on top of your existing axios setup, so things like base URL, authentication and errors would be handled in axios, then the axios instance passed to Axios Actions classes:

```js
import axios from 'axios'
axios.defaults.baseURL = '...'
axios.interceptors.request.use( ... )
axios.interceptors.response.use( ... )

const endpoint = new ApiEndpoint(axios, config)
```

### Adding actions

Any of the main classes can have actions added to them at any point:

```js
const comments = new ApiEndpoint('comments/:id')
comments.add('search', 'comments/search?user=:userId&text=:text')
```
Again, prepend the HTTP method to the front of the URL if you need to, then execute via `call()` or the automatically-created method:

```js
comments
  .search(form)
  .then(onSearch)
```

The method supports an alternative long-hand signature where by you can manually specify the HTTP method and also an action-level handler, which is called only on a successful call to the URL endpoint:

```js
comments.add(action, path, method, handler)
```

Note that a method in the path will always override a method passed as an argument.

Actions can be added to any `ApiGroup` instances, or if greater functionality is required, you can [extend from a base class](#extending-classes) and add your own custom methods.


### Handling events

Events can be handled in three ways:

- per call
- per group of actions
- per action

To set up call-level event handling, use `done()` and `fail()` on the Api instance:

```js
const posts = new ApiEndpoint('posts/:id')
  .done(onLoad)
  .fail(onError)
```
```js
posts.index()
```

To set up group-level event handling, use `when()` on any `ApiGroup` (or subclass) instance:

```js
const posts = new ApiEndpoint('posts/:id')
  .when('create update delete', onAction)
```
```js
function onAction (res, action) {
    console.log(`action: ${action}`, res)
    posts.index() // reload
}
posts.create({title: 'new post', body: 'this is a new post'})
```

Note that the handler will only be called for successful calls.

To set up action-level event handling, use `then()` and `catch()` on the call return:

```js
const posts = new ApiEndpoint('posts/:id')
```
```js
posts
  .index()
  .then(res => this.data = res.data.map(post => new Post(post)))
```


## Advanced functionality

### Modifying request or response data

The `Http` class which manages the Axios calls allows you to modify the outgoing data and incoming responses in a similar manner to Axios intercepters, via `before` and `after` arrays.

To modify data or response, add handler functions:

```js
endpoint.http.before.push(data => onRequest)
endpoint.http.after.push(data => onResponse)
```

You can import the `process` helper function to abstract the response data whether it's an array or a single object:

```js
import { helpers } from 'axios-actions'
function onResponse (res) {
  helpers.process(res.data => item => {
    Object
      .keys(item)
      .forEach(key => {
        item[key] = String(item).toUpperCase()
      })
  })
}
```

### Plugins

Plugins wrap up the kind of functionality above into easy-to-use functions that can be called directly, or added by name to all Api classes.

There are currently three plugins:

- `resource` - converts outgoing and incoming data to and from models
- `remap` - remaps key names from client to server and back again
- `data` - returns the data component only from any calls

To use plugins, use the `use()` method of any of the Api classes:

```js
const endpoint = new ApiEndpoint(axios, config)
  .use('resource', Post)
  .use('remap', { the_title: 'title'}, the_body: 'body')
  .use('data')
```

See the plugins file itself for all built-in plugin functions:

- [src/functions/plugins.ts](https://github.com/davestewart/axios-actions/blob/master/src/functions/plugins.ts)


### Creating your own plugins

Very simply, plugins are functions which take any Api instance, then any parameters you want to pass:

```js
function doSomething (api, foo, bar) { ... }
```

To extend the uppercase example from the previous section, we might do the following:

```js
import { helpers } from 'axios-actions'

// create plugin
function changeCase (api, state) {
  const transform = state ? 'toUpperCase': 'toLowerCase'
  const onResponse = function (res) {
    helpers.process(res.data => item => {
      Object
        .keys(item)
        .forEach(key => {
          item[key] = String(item)[transform]()
        })
    })
  }
  api.http.after.push(res => onResponse)
}
```

To implement it in our project, we can do the following:

```js
// add to global plugins
import { plugins } from 'axios-actions'
plugins.changeCase = changeCase

// implement via use()
const posts = new ApiEndpoint('posts/:id')
    .use('changeCase', true)
```
```js
// implement via calling
changeCase(posts, false) 
```

You can do anything you like with the `api` instance in the plugin, for example adding callbacks:

```js
plugins.log = function (api) {
  api.fail(error => {
    console.log('ERROR!', error)
    return Promise.reject(error)
  })
}
```


### Extending classes

A typical use case for Axios Actions is also to extend an existing class with your own methods.

The following example shows how to decouple your API from your Flux-based (Vuex) store, using it only for shared data:

```js
import axios from 'axios'
import { ApiEndpoint } from 'axios-actions'
import store from './store'

class VuexResource extends ApiEndpoint {
  constructor (path, mutation) {
    super(axios, path)
    this
      .when('create update delete', () => this.index())
      .when('index', data => store.commit(mutation, data))
      .use('data')
  }
}

```
```js
const posts = new VuexResource('posts/:id', 'posts/data')
posts.index()
posts.create({ ... }) // no handlers needed; new data loads in automatically!
```
